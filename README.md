# SQL-Portfolio-Project
This project was performed using MySQL Workbench; it involves the use of a 
model Supermart dataset comprising of 3 different data tables - Customer, Product
and Sales. The idea behind this project is to perform exploratory data analysis to
identify insights for business growth and of course, to sharpen my data querying skills.

P.S: Attached are the datasets used for the project in .csv format
